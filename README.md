# mental-health-in-tech
Analyzed OSMI mental health survey data to evaluate the relevancy of mental health (i.e. diagnosis, healthcare coverage, open discourse) within the American tech industry.

## Overview
Mental health is an increasingly prevalent issue in the 21st century, with nearly one in five Americans experiencing some form of mental illness (51.5 million in 2019, according to the National Institute of Mental Health). The goal of this project is to explore the intersection of mental health and the technology industry by analyzing survey results regarding American workers’ perceptions and frequency of mental illness throughout the past five years. Conducting this analysis allows for greater insight into how mental health is considered within an industry that is commonly known for frequent burnouts and high stress levels. 

Through the analysis of this survey, the overarching question our group strived to answer was, “Are workers in the tech industry more likely to experience some form of mental illness than workers who do not work in the tech industry?” Nuances within this general inquiry involved exploring the potential relationships between demographic information (i.e. age, gender, race, and location) and workplace characteristics (i.e. mental health benefits in healthcare coverage, mental health discourse among co-workers and employers) towards having a mental health disorder or not. 

## Data
The survey data is sourced from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) from 2014 to 2019 and is made accessible by Kaggle in a SQLite file (to which we converted to a .CSV file). However, it is important to note the limitations that exist within this survey, since anyone is able to visit the OSMI website and answer whichever questions they would like. This can lead to biases in the representation of the members within the tech industry.
