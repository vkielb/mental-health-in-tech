# mental-health-in-tech
Analyzed OSMI mental health survey data to evaluate the relevancy of mental health (i.e. diagnosis, healthcare coverage, open discourse) within the American tech industry.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the intersection of mental health and the technology industry by analyzing survey results regarding American workersâ€™ perceptions and frequency of mental illness throughout the past five years. Conducting this analysis allows for greater insight into how mental health is considered within an industry that is commonly known for frequent burnouts and high stress levels. 

Nuances within this general inquiry involves exploring the potential relationships between demographic information (i.e. age, gender, race, and location) and workplace characteristics (i.e. mental health benefits in healthcare coverage, mental health discourse among co-workers and employers) in various workplace environments. 

## Data
The survey data is sourced from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) from 2014 to 2019 and is made accessible by Kaggle in a SQLite file (to which we converted to a .CSV file). However, it is important to note the limitations that exist within this survey, since anyone is able to visit the OSMI website and answer whichever questions they would like. This can lead to biases in the representation of the members within the tech industry.
